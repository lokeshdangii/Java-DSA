**NOTE: There are some basic problems in each folder which are for the practice purpose of that topic.**

## Explore Programs/Problems

To explore the programs from this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   
       git clone https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java.git
       
2. Navigate to the cloned Java directory:

       cd Path_to_Java/Java
     
3. Compile the Java file:

       javac <filename.java>
   
4. Now run the Java file with:

       java <filename>

You can examine the problems and programs, modify them, and experiment with them according to your approach.

## Prerequisite

To run the Java Programs in your local system **Java Development Kit (JDK)** must be installed in your local system. You can download and install JDK as per your system type ([Windows](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_windows-x64_bin.exe), [Linux](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_linux-x64_bin.deb), [Mac](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_macos-aarch64_bin.dmg)).
